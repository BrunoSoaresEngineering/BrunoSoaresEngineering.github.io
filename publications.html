                  Obtaining flat initialization of complex Renewable Power Plant models
                </h3>
                <p>IET - Institution of Engineering and Technology</p>
                <p>
                  The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources has triggered a
                  tremendous transformation of the power generation sources away from synchronous to
                  inverter-based resources (IBR). To safeguard the stable operation of the power
                  systems with high shares of IBR, grid operators require electrical simulation
                  models to reflect the power plant performance with very high fidelity under any
                  operating condition. To accurately reflect real plant performance,
                  electrical simulation models need to be either source code integrated, or a very
                  close implementation of the algorithms executed on the plants. Utilities are
                  interested in performing wide area studies using dynamic simulation models, which
                  have historically been done using Root Mean Square (RMS) models. To achieve this,
                  large network models comprising a variety of dynamic simulation models from
                  different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are considered. If not well
                  managed, such simulation models become very challenging to handle. Therefore,
                  strict requirements on “flat-start” of models are commonplace. For RMS models this
                  requires exact initialization of all state variables from the initial load-flow,
                  and for electro-magnetic transient (EMT) models steady state shall be reached in
                  few seconds. This paper focuses on the challenges to achieve flat-start touching
                  not only on the dynamic model design, but also on the importance of departing from
                  an accurate load-flow model. Recommendations to build simulation cases are
                  provided as well as proposals for new functionalities in RMS and EMT simulation
                  tools to overcome these obstacles.

                  The purpose of this paper is to outline the challenges found during the
                  verification process for simulation model performance in several
                  commercial RMS and EMT simulation tools required by ERCOT. These challenges are
                  categorized into 2 main groups: Simulation Tool Limitations (STL)
                  and Simulation Model Simplification (SMS). STL covers intrinsic conditions of RMS
                  tools when compared to EMT tools like software solver, time step,
                  acceleration factor. SMS's consist of simplifications used for the model
                  development in a RMS environment, to adapt to phasor domain calculation and
                  longer simulation time steps. The paper highlights the lessons learned,
                  recommended practices, and underlying reasons for discrepancies when
                  benchmarking simulation results from RMS tools against EMT tools. Finally, the
                  paper elaborates how Vestas's solution overcomes the challenges by
                  using a full code integrated model called, based on the original control developed
                  by the different Vestas design teams for both wind turbine and power
                  plant controller products, which is shared between RMS and EMT tools and maintains
                  a 1-to-1 parametrization with the real product. The model scrutiny
                  process for ERCOT is positively impacting the quality of models for other markets.

                    Characterization of Substation Process Bus Network Delays
                  </a>
                </h3>

                <p>
                  The paper presents the characterization of network delays in an IEC61850 process
                  bus substation area network, both through theoretical analysis and simulations.
                  Several design targets were defined considering the recommendations of standards
                  and good design practices: number of network hops; total network delay;
                  probability of the delay being exceeded; link load; network topology and
                  availability. An analytical delay estimation methodology is proposed, considering
                  both the steady-state traffic and traffic resulting from a breaker failure event.
                  A complete substation is taken as example for characterizing the network delays,
                  considering a star network topology. Simulations allow obtaining the cumulative
                  distribution functions and percentile values of network delays. Results show a
                  good agreement between the simulation and the analytical analysis. While the delay
                  is best characterized statistically through simulation, finding the maximum
                  network delay through simulations can be very time consuming, making the
                  analytical analysis more suitable.

                  An integrated simulation model of power system protection schemes and IEC 61850
                  process bus communication models was developed for the design of substation
                  automation systems of the future. The model is capable of reproducing a sequence
                  of the relevant events and equipment states under different operation scenarios,
                  including normal operation and power system fault disturbances. The model includes
                  a description of the power system, the protection scheme, including its several
                  intelligent electronic devices, and the process bus communication network. The
                  model allows an assessment of the functional correctness of steady-state operation
                  of the protection scheme as well as during a power system fault clearance process.
                  It also allows the performance evaluation of the underlying communication network.
                  The capabilities of the model are illustrated with an example scenario of power
                  system fault followed by circuit breaker failure.

                    Condition-based maintenance: A forward step on the power system protection

                  This paper demonstrates an advanced model which integrates both corrective and
                  condition-based maintenance in the Portuguese Transmission System Operator (TSO)
                  protection system. It also identifies the relevance of protection system condition
                  indices for the maintenance decision-making process. The developed model analyses
                  data from every fault event till a three level back-up system and decides which
                  type of maintenance to apply. A detailed example of this decision making model
                  is illustrated in this paper.
